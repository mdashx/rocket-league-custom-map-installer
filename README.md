I tried to download the maps programmatically from Google Drive, but Google shows a virus warning, so for now you can download from my Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r21dcYXoGyNmvimnYIXohfGgzEilDLtn?usp=share_link

If someone provides me with download links (e.g. download Leth's maps from his site, etc.) I will put them in the download script.

Download the maps to this directory and then right-click "installMaps.ps1" and "Run with PowerShell". This script will overwrite the "Labs" maps with the custom maps.

Here are the the custom maps and the corresponding Labs maps that the overwrite.

- AimTrainingRL.udk
- DribbleChallenge2Overhaul.udk
- LethNeonHeightsRings.udk
- speed_jump_rings2.udk
- LethIceRings.udk
- noob_dribble.udk

- Labs_DoubleGoal_V2_P.upk
- Labs_Utopia_P.upk
- Labs_CirclePillars_P.upk
- Labs_Cosmic_V4_P.upk
- Labs_Octagon_02_P.upk
- Labs_Underpass_P.upk

You can edit the script to use your preferred maps or contact me if you need help. If anyone wants to use this, I can create an interface so that the maps installation is customizable.
